# PasswordGenerator
Everytime I'm in need of a password randomly generated, I've endup googling one, and invariably would get the LastPass as the first result. Their tool is great, but lately it needs yet another click to get to it, and also have to ignore the rest of their page, and the additional offer after clicking copy!

So I've had enough, hence the reason behind this - make my own password generator. It may not be as shiny as others, but it comes with no ads and pushovers - just what it says on the tin.
